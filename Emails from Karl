Hi all,

Thanks for looking at the data for me. Jono said it would be OK.

I have put the data into a spreadsheet and given it a good clean, so it should be good to go. The data is here:

The experiment looks at the effect of a new treatment on gene expression. We compared it to saline which we used as a placebo. We also looked at two cell lines.

We then added different concentrations of a growth factor to see the effect on gene expression.

We are interested in the effect of treatment on the effect of growth factor on gene expression.

Please could you have a look at the data and get me some slides that I can show the lab boss by C.O.B Friday March 24th, that will be smashing. Just a couple of slides showing some of the stats and some plots to show the relationship in PowerPoint would be perfect. Just email the slides once you have them

Lovely
Karl

Hi William, 

In the lab, we use -99 to indicate that the value is missing.
