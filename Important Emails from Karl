Hi all,

Thanks for looking at the data for me. Jono said it would be OK.

I have put the data into a spreadsheet and given it a good clean, so it should be good to go. The data is here:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DCTEBES-uS0sz3QCSJZ_pfzwV6Gw6J9qiay74yz94dQ/edit?usp=sharing

The experiment looks at the effect of a new treatment on gene expression. We compared it to saline which we used as a placebo. We also looked at two cell lines.

We then added different concentrations of a growth factor to see the effect on gene expression.

We are interested in the effect of treatment on the effect of growth factor on gene expression.

Please could you have a look at the data and get me some slides that I can show the lab boss by C.O.B Friday March 24th, that will be smashing. Just a couple of slides showing some of the stats and some plots to show the relationship in PowerPoint would be perfect. Just email the slides once you have them

Lovely
Karl

Hi William, 

In the lab, we use -99 to indicate that the value is missing.

Hi all, 

Sorry to do this to you, but I need a plot for a conference that I am attending this weekend. 

Jono made me this wonderful plot for me - attached, but the font is wrong. 

The conference requirements are Times New Roman, and also they will only except a tiff file (9in x 6in) with a resolution of 500. 

Jono would normally change it for me, but he is not answering his email. 

Please can you make the plot for me. I am happy to add you as an author to the conference. 

Sorry, but I need it by COB on Thursday as I am flying out on Good Friday. 

Thank you
Karl

Hi all, 

Great news everyone, my boss is keen for me to put in a grant application, and he is fine for me to include you for 0.1% of the grant. 

Unfortunately, he only told me today and the grant is due on Friday 5th May at 5pm. No problem, I have completed the grant, but just need a sample size calculation. 

We are going to do a linear regression of gene expression with the predictors concentration, cell age, treatment (two levels), cell type (two levels), and media (two levels). We have done a previous study and got an $R^2$ of 0.1 between the predictors and the response level. 

If we want a power of 90% and a significance level of 0.05 how many samples in total do we need?

Cheers,
Karl.

Hi all, 

Thanks for all of the work so far. We are thinking of writing this analysis up as a paper. If possible, please could you send me a report - usual IMRaD - of a predictive model of gene expression. 

So I can get the paper written - if I could have the report by 5pm Friday May 26th 2023, then that would be smashing. 

Cheers,
Karl.

There are no units for gene expression. No code please, cell type is the terminology for Wild-type verses CT101, cell line refers to the individual cells that we grew.
