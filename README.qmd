# Manual cleaning of data

Manually cleaned the WTF-IISfD data.xlsx, copying into two new files. Firstly, in manually-cleaned-data.csv getting the vectors of gene expression for each trial as variables (with concentration the independent variable).

Then, cleaned again to manually-cleaned-data-v2.csv where gene expression is only one variable, with each trial as a separate set of rows, and the details of the trial (treatment and gene_type) given by extra categorical variables.

# Plots

Script for experimenting with plots. See 01_plots.R in the R folder.

Tables user the "wider" manually-cleaned-data.csv whereas the plots use the "longer" manually-cleaned-data-v2.csv

This file does not contain the final best version of the plots - that is in slides.qmd !!!

# Deliverable 1: Slides

File: slides.qmd in main directory.

For implementing the plots from the 01_plots.R in a way that is exportable to PowerPoint (the desired format of Karl Berator).

# Deliverable 2: Plot

Received the plot to emulate, saved as gene_plot.pdf

Write R script gene_plot_updating.R to create a version of the plot that has:

- Font: Times New Roman

- .tiff format

- (9in x 6in) with a resolution of 500

Plot appears to be using the same data as those we had previously looked at.
