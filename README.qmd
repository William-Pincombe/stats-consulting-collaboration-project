# Cleaning of data

Manually cleaned the `WTF-IISfD data.xlsx`, copying into two new `.csv` files. These files are saved within a folder called `cleaned-data`. These files 

* in `manually-cleaned-data-wide.csv`, I took the values of gene expression for each observation series saved each as a variable, with the concentration as the independent variable.

* in `manually-cleaned-data-long.csv`, gene expression is only one variable, with each trial (for different treatment, gene type and gene line) as a separate set of rows. The details for each observation, treatment, gene type and gene line, are given by categorical variables.

I have generally used `manually-cleaned-data-long.csv` in analysis.


# Plots

Script for experimenting with plots. See 01_plots.R in the R folder.

Tables user the "wider" `manually-cleaned-data-wide.csv` whereas the plots use the "longer" `manually-cleaned-data-long.csv`

This file does not contain the final version of these plots - that is in `slides.qmd` in the `slides` folder.

# Deliverable 1: Slides

See the `slides` folder.

Slides were initially constructed using `slides.qmd` in main directory, to create the figures and tables. This was for implementing the plots from the 01_plots.R in a way that is exportable to PowerPoint (the desired format of Karl Berator).

The compiled output of `slides.qmd` was then edited manually using LibreOffice Impress (an open-source alternative for PowerPoint) and the result was saved in `Slides for Karl.pptx`

# Deliverable 2: Plot

See the `gene-plot` folder.

Received the plot to emulate, saved as `gene_plot.pdf` in folder `gene_plot`.

Write R script `gene_plot_updating.R` to create a version of the plot that has:

* Font: Times New Roman

* .tiff format

* (9in x 6in) with a resolution of 500

Plot uses the same data we had previously looked at, imported from `manually-cleaned-data-long.csv`.

The Times New Roman font file is in the directory to be called on within the script.

The script saves the plot as a `.tiff` file with the specified characteristics, called `gene_plot_updated.tiff`.

So that this file could be sent via email, I manually (using the Linux Mint operating system) compressed it into a `.zip` file, called `gene_plot_updated.zip`.

# Deliverable 3: Sample size calculation

R script to do the calculation is `03_regression_sample_size.R` in the `R` folder.

# Deliverable 4: IMRaD Report

The IMRaD report is in a folder called `IMRaD Report`.

The report is a Quarto markdown document, `imrad.qmd`, which called on a bibliography in BibTeX format `imrad.bib`.

The Times New Roman font file is also saved in this directory so that it can be used as the font in the plots in the report.

# Miscellaneous

In the top-level directory:

* `models.qmd` contains my experiments with fitting mixed-effects models.

* `Important Emails from Karl` is a text file containing some emails from Karl Berator which specified the tasks - so that I could look over more easily
