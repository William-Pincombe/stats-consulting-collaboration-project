A guide document to everything done in the collaboration project with Karl Berator.

# Raw Data

The data file `WTF-IISfD data.xlsx` was received from Karl Berator through a Google Drive link on 1st March 2023. It is saved in the `raw-data` folder.

# Cleaning of data

Manually cleaned the data from Karl by copying into two new `.csv` files in LibreOffice Calc. These files are saved within a folder called `cleaned-data`.

* in `manually-cleaned-data-wide.csv`, the values of gene expression for each observation series are saved as a column, with the concentration as the independent variable. This file does not contain information about the gene line.

* in `manually-cleaned-data-long.csv`, gene expression is only one variable, with each trial (for different treatment, gene type and gene line) as a separate set of rows. The details for each observation, treatment, gene type and gene line, are given by categorical variables.

I have generally used `manually-cleaned-data-long.csv` in analysis.


# Plots

`01_plots.R` in the `R` folder is a script for experimenting with plots.

Tables user the "wider" `manually-cleaned-data-wide.csv` whereas the plots use the "longer" `manually-cleaned-data-long.csv`

This file does not contain the final version of these plots - that is in `slides.qmd` in the `slides` folder.

# Deliverable 1: Slides

See the `slides` folder.

Slides were initially constructed using `slides.qmd` in main directory, to create the figures and tables. This was for implementing the plots from the 01_plots.R in a way that is exportable to PowerPoint (the desired format of Karl Berator).

The compiled output of `slides.qmd` was then edited manually using LibreOffice Impress (an open-source alternative for PowerPoint) and the result was saved in `Slides for Karl.pptx`

# Deliverable 2: Plot

See the `gene-plot` folder.

Received the plot to emulate, saved as `gene_plot.pdf` in folder `gene-plot`.

Write R script `gene_plot_updating.R` to create a version of the plot that has:

* Font: Times New Roman

* .tiff format

* (9in x 6in) with a resolution of 500

Plot uses the same data we had previously looked at, imported from `manually-cleaned-data-long.csv`.

The Times New Roman font file is in the directory to be called on within the script.

The script saves the plot as a `.tiff` file with the specified characteristics, called `gene_plot_updated.tiff`.

So that this file could be sent via email, I manually (using the Linux Mint operating system) compressed it into a `.zip` file, called `gene_plot_updated.zip`.

# Deliverable 3: Sample size calculation

R script to do the calculation is `03_regression_sample_size.R` in the `R` folder.

I calculated the sample size using the `pwr.f2.test` function from the `pwr` package. This function can calculate, for a linear model, one of the following from values of all four others:

* numerator degrees of freedom $u$

* denominator degrees of freedom $v$

* effect size

* significance level

* power

Karl specified in his email that he wants power of 90% and a significance level of 0.05.

He also specified that he had an $R^2$ of 0.1. We can calculate the effect size $f^2$ from this using the formula which can be found in *Sample Size Determination and Power* by Thomas P. Ryan, 2013, on page 149:

$$
f^2 = \frac{R^2}{1-R^2}
$$

The function is doing an F-test, so if we have $k$ parameters and $n$ observations, the degrees of freedom are $u = k$ and $v = n - k - 1$. 
The number of parameters counts:

* each continuous predictor once

* each factor variable the number of levels minus 1, for the base level

In Karl's case, there are two continuous predictors (concentration and cell age) and three factor predictors (treatment, cell type and media), each with 2 levels, so we have $k = 2+3\times (2-1) = 5$ predictors, so we know that $u = 5$ and $v = n - 6$.

We then input the power, significance level, effect size and numerator degrees of freedom $u$ into the function to calculate the required denominator degrees of freedom $v$, and then let $n = v + 6$.

# Modelling

Our goal in modelling was to analyse at the relationship between gene expression and concentration, and how this was impacted by the treatment. 

`models.qmd` contains my experiments with fitting mixed-effects models, although the report `imrad.qmd` in the `IMRaD-report` folder contains the best version of these models.

I used the "long" format data for modelling, so we have five variables:

* `Gene Expression` is a continuous variable.

* `Concentration` of growth factor, measured in $\mu$g/ml, is a continuous variable taking integer values between 0 and 11.

* `Treatment` is a factor variable with levels AF42 and placebo.

* `Cell Type` is a factor variable with levels WT and CT101.

* `Gene Line` is a factor variable with 8 levels: CsE, bNo, JZC, fUg, jEK, Hoe, Rza and xpo.

I firstly did Exploratory Data Analysis on the data, with a series of plots in the `models.qmd` file.

I initially fitted a simple linear model using concentration, treatment and cell type as predictors for gene expression, including interaction terms between treatment and concentration and between cell type and concentration.

I then fit a mixed-effects model, with the same predictors as the fixed effects, including the interaction terms, with gene line as an intercept-only random effect.

I then fit models excluding each of treatment and cell type, to compare the model metrics (AIC and BIC) with those in the model 


I experimented with a random slope model into a random intercept and random slope model, but was informed that this was not necessary for the project.



# Deliverable 4: IMRaD Report

The IMRaD report is in a folder called `IMRaD-report`.

The report is a Quarto markdown document, `imrad.qmd`, which calls on a bibliography in BibTeX format `imrad.bib`.

The Times New Roman font file is also saved in this directory so that it can be used as the font in the plots in the report.


# Miscellaneous

In the top-level directory:

* `Important Emails from Karl` is a text file containing some emails from Karl Berator which specified the tasks - so that I could look over more easily
